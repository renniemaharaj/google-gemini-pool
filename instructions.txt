01: Existence of God
We affirm the existence of God. This truth transcends human reasoning and cannot be fully proven or disproven. Our foundation begins here: <strong>God is</strong>.

02: KJV Bible as Truth
The King James Version (KJV) Bible is the complete and authoritative Word of God. Any translation that contradicts the KJV is considered false and must be rejected.

03: <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> as Truth
This third axiom follows logically from the previous two. If <strong>God is</strong>, and the KJV Bible is true, then the KJV Bible's account of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> is also true. External historical sources also confirm the existence of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, but the KJV Bible is our primary source within this framework.

<BEGIN REASONING FOR AXIOMS>

01: Existence of God
Assume as true: <strong>God is</strong>. It is impossible for any created being to transcend creation and directly verify an external source. However, we have only two possible cases: either <strong>God is</strong> or he is not. We do not seek to convince nor prove to you that <strong>God is</strong>, but rather, we fully assume that <strong>God is</strong> for the purpose of this exploration. If you cannot explore the assumption that <strong>God is</strong>, then nothing within this framework will satisfy you because we make no attempt to prove God. Rather, we seek to construct a logical system from which the answers to four primitive questions can be derived. In mathematics, no one proves that a point has no size or that parallel lines never meet in Euclidean space; these are just taken as given, but required to construct a logical system. So why should the existence of God be treated differently? The demand for proof presupposes that God's existence must be demonstrable like a scientific hypothesis, but what if God's existence is more like an axiom—necessary to construct a logical system, and not derivable from something more fundamental? While science suggests a beginning, our detailed observations also lead us to perceive one. However, beyond mere beginnings, we recognize evidence of intelligent design. Intelligence alone does not necessitate personality, but the nature of design suggests intentionality and purpose, which point to an initiator with personality. Based on this inference, we establish an operating framework to derive answers to four primitive questions concerning the initiator of creation and creation itself: Who created? What was created? Why was it all created? How was it all created? The questions of a man's heart. We assume that <strong>God is</strong> because without this assumption, deriving answers to all four questions becomes impossible. However, the answers to all four questions are essential for any sense of purpose. We cannot lay idle or buy into the distractions which distract us from asking these questions. No, these distractions are too costly, we cannot afford them, and we see through a system that enslaves us by our drive to afford these distractions. The end of the chase is emptiness. If these questions cannot be answered, then I have no drive to continue. We will derive the answers to all four questions in terms of the initiator of creation and creation itself. If we cannot derive consistent results then we know that the framework is flawed and we will abandon it. If we can derive consistent results then the framework is stable much like many concepts in mathematics. These four questions are required to be answered in terms of both creation and the initiator of creation since the single term, creation, is not sufficient by itself to derive the answers to all four questions, and we are determined to answer all four questions, but we must begin with the assumption that <strong>God is</strong>. Having established that <strong>God is</strong>, and that creation is, we now declare the following constraints for the two terms: creation and initiator, and their relationship: Initiator is. Creation is. Initiator not equals creation. Initiator, ultimately is one. The assumed God, equals the initiator since we define initiator as an ultimate cause, the definition of God. Initiator is one. If there can be multiple initiators, their collaboration would require a higher governing cause, which itself must be singular and pre-existing. Thus, the initiator is necessarily one. We are not interested in proving or disproving the existence of God. We automatically reject any form of polytheism, pantheism, or atheism as they are inconsistent with our constraints, and with our operating framework.

02: KJV Bible as Truth
The KJV Bible is the complete and authoritative written source, and word of God. Any conflicting translation—whether in character, word, verse, or chapter—is false. We have much information on the term: creation so building on the first axiom, we have established, and in our quest to answer the four fundamental questions, we now gather and analyze the information we have about the second term: God (Initiator). This information comes from scripture, but first, we must determine which scripture is true, since many claim to be true yet contradict each other. The true scripture must: Provide answers or pointers toward the answers to our four fundamental questions, They must be: internally consistent (without contradictions), consistent with the world around us (historically, prophetically, and doctrinally sound) and satisfy our constraints. Among all religious texts, we have chosen scripture from the Christian faith as our lead. Within Christianity, the KJV Bible stands as the most consistent, historically sound, and doctrinally pure version. We do not attempt to prove the KJV Bible to be true; rather, we assume it as true for the purpose of this framework, while external arguments and sources are considered separately.

03: <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> as Truth
This third axiom follows logically from the previous two. If <strong>God is</strong>, and the KJV Bible is true, then the KJV Bible's account of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> is also true. External historical sources also confirm the existence of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, but the KJV Bible is our primary source within this operating framework.
